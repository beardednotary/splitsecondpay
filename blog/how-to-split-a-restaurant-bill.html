            <p class="meta">
              A quick, practical guide to splitting checks with friends — without awkward calculator huddles.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            You’re out with friends, the server drops one check, and suddenly everyone is doing
            messy mental math over sales tax, tip, and “who got what.” It’s 2025 — we can do better than
            passing someone’s phone around with the default calculator app.
          </p>

          <p>
            This guide walks through <span class="inline-highlight">how to split a restaurant bill the easy way</span>:
            what’s fair, what’s normal, how to handle tip and tax, and how to avoid the awkward
            “uhh… you still owe $7” conversation later.
          </p>

            <div class="card-title">TL;DR: The 3-Tap Method</div>
            <p>The simplest flow for most groups:</p>
            <div class="pill-steps">
              <div class="pill-step"><span>1</span> Enter the bill subtotal</div>
              <div class="pill-step"><span>2</span> Choose the tip percentage</div>
              <div class="pill-step"><span>3</span> Pick how many people are splitting</div>
            </div>
            <p>
              That’s literally the flow SplitSecond Pay is built around —
              <a href="https://splitsecondpay.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one screen, no extra math</a>.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>Step 1: Decide How You’re Splitting</h2>

          <p>Before anyone touches a card, agree on the basic approach:</p>

          <h3>Option A: Split Evenly</h3>
          <p>
            Easiest for most dinners where people ordered roughly similar things.
            You take the total (with tax and tip), divide by the number of people, and each person pays the same amount.
          </p>

          <p>Use this when:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Everyone ordered within ~$5–10 of each other</li>
            <li>You shared most items (apps, bottle of wine, etc.)</li>
            <li>It’s a regular hangout, not a super tight-budget situation</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Option B: “I Had the Steak” Split</h3>
          <p>
            If one person ordered a significantly more expensive meal (or cocktails, or dessert),
            it’s totally reasonable to adjust.
          </p>
          <p>Common way to handle this:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Split shared items evenly (apps, sides, shared dessert)</li>
            <li>Add each person’s individual main + drinks</li>
            <li>Apply tax and tip proportionally to each person’s total</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This is the type of calculation where a bill splitter app starts saving you serious time,
            especially once you’ve set your <span class="inline-highlight">default tax and tip</span>.
          </p>

          <h2>Step 2: Handle Tax the Smart Way</h2>

          <p>
            Most people either forget about tax entirely or fudge it with a random guess.
            In reality, tax can add <strong>7–10%+</strong> to the bill depending on where you live.
          </p>

          <p>Two simple ways to handle tax:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Even split:</strong> Add tax to the bill total, then divide evenly.</li>
            <li><strong>Itemized split:</strong> Multiply each person’s pre-tax total by <code>(1 + tax rate)</code>.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-title">Quick Example</div>
            <p>
              Dinner subtotal: <strong>$120</strong><br />
              Local tax: <strong>8%</strong> → $9.60<br />
              New total before tip: <strong>$129.60</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead of doing that from scratch every time, apps like SplitSecond Pay let you
              <span class="inline-highlight">save your tax rate once</span> (e.g., 8%) and it’s baked into every future split.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>Step 3: Pick a Tip Without Overthinking It</h2>

          <p>
            Tipping norms have shifted, but for sit-down restaurants in the U.S. in 2025, most people land here:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>18–20%</strong> for standard service</li>
            <li><strong>22–25%</strong> for great service or large groups</li>
            <li><strong>15%</strong> if service was okay but not amazing</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The key is consistency. If you eat out often, it’s way easier to:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Set a <span class="inline-highlight">“standard tip”</span> (e.g., 20%)</li>
            <li>Set a <span class="inline-highlight">“great service”</span> option (e.g., 25%)</li>
            <li>Tap between them instead of manually typing numbers each time</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-title">Tip On Subtotal or On Total?</div>
            <p>
              Some people tip on the <strong>pre-tax subtotal</strong>, others on the
              <strong>post-tax total</strong>. The important thing is to be consistent.
            </p>
            <p>
              SplitSecond Pay literally has a setting for this:
              <span class="inline-highlight">“Calculate tip on post-tax total”</span>.
              Turn it on or off once, and you never think about it again.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>Step 4: Make Payment Easy for Everyone</h2>

          <p>Once you’ve got everyone’s share, you’ve got a few options:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Everyone pays the restaurant directly</strong> (multiple cards, tap-to-pay)</li>
            <li><strong>One person pays</strong> and everyone else sends them money</li>
            <li><strong>Mix of both</strong> — e.g., couples share, singles pay individually</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            In 2025, the most common flow is still: <strong>one person pays, everyone else Venmos them</strong>.
            That works great — as long as you don’t spend 5 minutes typing notes and amounts.
          </p>

          <div class="card card-cta">
            <div class="card-title">How SplitSecond Pay Handles This</div>
            <p>Once you’ve calculated the bill, SplitSecond Pay lets you:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>See your share in huge, readable numbers</li>
              <li>Share a clean breakdown via text or group chat</li>
              <li>Send payment requests through Venmo or PayPal (Pro)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              It’s built for that exact “end of meal” moment — when the server is waiting and
              nobody wants to open three different apps just to figure out the math.

          <h2>Etiquette: What’s Actually Normal in 2025?</h2>

          <p>Some quick, non-awkward rules of thumb:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>On a first date?</strong> It’s still common for one person to offer to pay, but
              splitting is more accepted than ever. If in doubt: offer, and don’t argue if they insist.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Group of friends?</strong> Splitting evenly is usually fine unless someone very clearly
              ordered something way more expensive.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Someone isn’t drinking?</strong> It’s fair to remove alcohol from the split if
              one person skipped it entirely and everyone else had multiple rounds.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Travel or tight budgets?</strong> Itemized splits are more respectful — that’s when tools
              that handle tax and tip precisely really shine.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <div class="divider"></div>

          <h2>Putting It All Together (Example)</h2>

          <p>Here’s a realistic scenario:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Subtotal: <strong>$180</strong></li>
            <li>Tax: <strong>8.5%</strong> → $15.30</li>
            <li>Tip: <strong>20%</strong> on post-tax = $39.06</li>
            <li>Total: <strong>$234.36</strong></li>
            <li>4 people splitting evenly → <strong>$58.59 each</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Doing that by hand while everyone is talking over you? Annoying.
            Doing it with a dedicated bill splitter that already knows your
            <span class="inline-highlight">tax rate, default tip, and typical split sizes</span>?
            That’s where the “3 taps” thing becomes real.
          </p>

          <div class="card card-cta">
            <div class="card-title">Try the 3-Tap Split the Next Time You Eat Out</div>
            <p>Next time the server drops one check, don’t open your calculator app.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Open SplitSecond Pay</li>
              <li>Enter the bill subtotal</li>
              <li>Tap your tip and how many people</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              That’s it. Your share pops up big and bold, and you can send requests or
              share the breakdown in seconds.
