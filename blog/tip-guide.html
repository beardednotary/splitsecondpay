          <h2>The Great Debate: Pre-Tax vs. Post-Tax Tipping</h2>
          <p>
            You’re standing at the table, bill in hand, trying to figure out the tip. The question isn't just
            <strong>how much</strong> to tip, but <strong>what amount</strong> to apply that percentage to:
            <strong>the pre-tax subtotal</strong> or <strong>the final, post-tax total</strong>?
          </p>
          <p>
            While both methods are common, understanding the difference—and what's considered proper etiquette—can save you money and ensure your server gets what they deserve.
          </p>

          <hr />

          <h2>💰 The Two Methods Explained</h2>
          <p>To illustrate, let's use a simple example:</p>

          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Scenario</th>
                <th>Value</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Subtotal (Food &amp; Drinks)</strong></td>
                <td>$50.00</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Sales Tax (Assumed)</strong></td>
                <td>8% ($4.00)</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Bill Total (Before Tip)</strong></td>
                <td>$54.00</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Tip Rate (Assumed)</strong></td>
                <td>20%</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <h3>1. Method 1: Tipping on the Pre-Tax Subtotal (The Standard)</h3>
          <p>
            This method calculates the tip based <strong>only</strong> on the cost of the goods and services you received, which is the <strong>subtotal ($50.00)</strong>.
          </p>

          <div class="formula-box">
            Tip Amount = Subtotal × Tip Rate
          </div>

          <p><strong>Calculation:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Tip Amount: $50.00 × 0.20 = <strong>$10.00</strong></li>
            <li>Final Total (with tip): $54.00 + $10.00 = <strong>$64.00</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Why it's the standard:</strong> Servers primarily provide service on the food and drinks, not the tax. Tipping on the pre-tax amount is the most widely accepted and recommended method for fair compensation.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Method 2: Tipping on the Post-Tax Total (The Easy Way)</h3>
          <p>
            This method calculates the tip based on the <strong>total amount after tax ($54.00)</strong>.
          </p>

          <div class="formula-box">
            Tip Amount = (Subtotal + Tax) × Tip Rate
          </div>

          <p><strong>Calculation:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Tip Amount: $54.00 × 0.20 = <strong>$10.80</strong></li>
            <li>Final Total (with tip): $54.00 + $10.80 = <strong>$64.80</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Why it's often used:</strong> It's easier and faster for mental math because the final total is often a clean number, and it’s a quick shortcut if you can’t easily find the subtotal.
          </p>

          <hr />

          <h2>⚖️ Why the Difference Matters</h2>
          <p>
            In the example above, the difference is only <strong>$0.80</strong> ($10.80 vs. $10.00). While small for a single bill, the differences add up:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>For the customer:</strong> Tipping on the post-tax total costs you slightly more. If you dine out frequently, this extra cost can accumulate over the year.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>For the server:</strong> They receive the same base tip either way, but the post-tax method provides a small, welcome bonus. Since tax rates are often a matter of state or local jurisdiction, the tax portion isn't a factor in their service quality.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The rule of thumb is: <strong>Tip on the pre-tax total.</strong> If you tip on the final, post-tax total, you are essentially tipping on the government's portion of the bill, but it is considered an equally generous gesture.
          </p>
